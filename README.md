## Day 1-2: Arrays
### Topics:
- Introduction to arrays: one-dimensional and multi-dimensional.
- Iterating through arrays.

### Practice:
1. Create an array to store the marks of 5 students and calculate the average.
2. Write a program to find the maximum and minimum values in an array.
3. Implement a 2D array for a tic-tac-toe game board.

## Day 3-4: Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation
### Topics:
- Basics of pointers and pointer arithmetic.
- Using `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` for dynamic memory allocation.

### Practice:
1. Write a program to dynamically allocate memory for an array of integers.
2. Implement a program to swap two numbers using pointers.

---

## Day 5: Stacks
### Topics:
- Stack data structure: LIFO principle.
- Implementation using arrays.

### Practice:
1. Implement a stack to reverse a string.
2. Create a simple expression evaluator using a stack.

---

## Day 6-7: Queues
### Topics:
- Queue data structure: FIFO principle.
- Circular queues and their implementation.

### Practice:
1. Simulate a ticket booking system using a queue.
2. Implement a circular queue to manage a printing job queue.

---

## Day 8: Linked Lists
### Topics:
- Singly linked list: creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Introduction to doubly linked lists.

### Practice:
1. Implement a program to create and display a singly linked list.
2. Write a program to insert an element at the beginning, middle, and end of a doubly linked list.

---

## Day 9: Hashing
### Topics:
- Basics of hashing.
- Handling collisions using chaining and open addressing.

### Practice:
1. Write a program to implement a simple hash table using chaining.
2. Implement a hash table with linear probing for collision resolution.

---

## Day 10-11: Trees
### Topics:
- Introduction to binary trees.
- Implementation of binary search trees (BST).
- Traversal methods: in-order, pre-order, post-order.

### Practice:
1. Create a program to insert and search elements in a BST.
2. Write a program to find the height of a binary tree.

---

## Day 12: Heaps
### Topics:
- Heap data structure: max heap and min heap.
- Applications of heaps (e.g., priority queues).

### Practice:
1. Implement a min-heap using an array.
2. Write a program to find the k largest elements in an array using a heap.

---

## Day 13: Graphs
### Topics:
- Graph representation: adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
- Basics of BFS and DFS.

### Practice:
1. Represent a social network using an adjacency list.
2. Implement BFS and DFS to find the shortest path in a graph.

---

## Day 14: Sorting Algorithms
### Topics:
- Basics of sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.
- Comparison of sorting techniques.

### Practice:
1. Write a program to implement Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.
2. Compare the execution time of Merge Sort and Quick Sort for a large dataset.

---

## Day 15: Comprehensive Project
### Project:
**Library Management System**:
- Use data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and hash tables.
- Features:
  - Add, search, and delete books.
  - Track book availability using a hash table.
  - Use a queue to manage book lending requests.
